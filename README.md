## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push this repository to GitHub (already done).
2. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).
3. Click **Deploy** — no additional configuration required.

## Customisation Notes

- **Placeholder content** — all names, addresses, phone numbers, and bios are placeholders. Replace them directly in the relevant page files under `app/`.
- **Color palette** — deep green (`#1B5E20`) and gold (`#F9A825`) are defined as Tailwind custom colors in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- **Faculty photos** — the current avatar uses initials. Replace the initials block in `app/faculty/page.tsx` with `next/image` components when real photos are available.
